## What's this?
This is a central repository that contains backend stuff for my upcoming FNaF fangame. This will be useful for making changes to game variables, such as characters, and uploading them as patches to update the game without downloading a new client version.<br><br>
This repository was not intended for the public, but it's easier to make it work that way, and you might like it, so take it!

## Contributions
After the first **public release** of the game is out, you can contribute in the following ways:
- Pull requests for game variables changes, improvements and other features that I will develop in the future.
- Issues to report bugs.

**NOTE:** I'm not accepting any pull requests made before the first public release.<br>
**NOTE 2:** The keynames in the files will be obfuscated while the game is under development until the reveal is announced.<br>
