## What's this?
This repository was not intended for the public, but it's easier to make it work that way, and you might like it, so take it!

## Contributions
After the first **public release** of the game is out, you can contribute in the following ways:
- Pull requests for game variables changes, improvements and other features that I will develop in the future.
- Issues to report bugs.
  
**NOTE:** The keynames in the files will be obfuscated while the game is under development until the reveal is announced.<br>
